# Global-Trends-in-Health-Metrics-Tableau-
In this project, I created visualizations of 4 different parameters obtained from 4 different datasets by pivoting them, and clubbing them into a single sheet to display an animation on the dashboard.

Some of the key features of this project are: 
• Used 4 different datasets consisting of metadata, population, fertility rate, and life-expectancy at birth of different countries from different continents
• Edited their blending relationships to help in creation of the animation
• Built the visualization incorporating different aspects of the data
• Added animations to the visualization prepared to make it more compelling
• Manually sorted the data which was blended
• Created a trail in the animations to indicate the trends of previous years
• Finalized the dashboard to create a compelling animation of the datasets
